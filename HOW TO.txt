Note: Be aware that in order for your Players to use Paid mods, they have to copy their Paid mods into the Resource folder of BeamMP.

That Folder can be accessed by right clicking the "BeamMP Launcher" shortcut on the desktop. Clicking "Open Folder" there and then navigating to the "Resources" folder in that new window.

Additional Note: Do not forget that everyone who does not have the paid mod cannot see these paid cars. For those players the paid mod users will appear as a Deep Black ball.
